I'll explain the complete workflow of your client-server application with diagrams.



```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph Server Startup
        A[Start Server] --> B[Create ServerSocket on port 8080]
        B --> C[Initialize ExecutorService]
        C --> D[Wait for Clients accept()]
    end

    subgraph Client Connection
        E[Start Client] --> F[Create Socket localhost:8080]
        F --> G[Initialize I/O Streams]
        G --> H[Start Receiver Thread]
        H --> I[Enter Message Loop]
    end

    subgraph Server Handler
        J[New Client Connected] --> K[Create Handler]
        K --> L[Initialize I/O Streams]
        L --> M[Send Welcome Message]
        M --> N[Enter Message Loop]
    end

    D -->|Client Connects| J
    F -->|Connection Request| D

    subgraph Message Flow
        O[Client Types Message] --> P[Client Writer Thread]
        P -->|Write to Socket| Q[Server Reader]
        Q --> R[Server Process]
        R -->|Write to Socket| S[Client Reader Thread]
        S --> T[Display Message]
    end

```

Let me explain the flow step by step:

1. Server Initialization:
```
1. Server starts up
   ├── Creates ServerSocket on port 8080
   ├── Initializes ThreadPool (ExecutorService)
   └── Begins waiting for clients (serverSocket.accept())
```

2. Client Initialization:
```
1. Client starts up
   ├── Creates Socket connecting to localhost:8080
   ├── Initializes BufferedReader and BufferedWriter
   ├── Starts daemon thread for receiving messages
   └── Enters main message loop for sending
```

Let's see the concurrent execution flows:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant S as Server
    participant H as Handler
    participant C as Client
    participant RT as Receiver Thread
    participant ->> as Request To

    S->>S: Start server
    S->>S: Wait for clients
    C->>S: Connect
    S->>H: Create handler
    H->>C: Send welcome

    par Client Send/Receive
        C->>H: Send message
        H->>C: Echo response
        and Background Receiving
        RT->>RT: Wait for messages
        RT->>C: Display received
    end

```

Detailed Program Flow:

1. **Server Side**
   ```
   Server
   │
   ├── main()
   │   └── Creates ServerSocket(8080)
   │
   └── handleClient()
       └── while(true)
           ├── socket = serverSocket.accept()  // Blocks until client connects
           ├── Create new Handler(socket)
           └── executorService.execute(handler::handleClientPerThread)
   ```

2. **Handler Side**
   ```
   Handler
   │
   ├── Constructor
   │   ├── Initialize BufferedReader
   │   └── Initialize BufferedWriter
   │
   └── handleClientPerThread()
       ├── Send welcome message
       └── while(!socket.closed)
           ├── Check for client message
           ├── Process message
           └── Send response
   ```

3. **Client Side**
   ```
   Client
   │
   ├── main()
   │   └── Create Socket("127.0.0.1", 8080)
   │
   ├── Receiver Thread
   │   └── while(running)
   │       ├── Read server messages
   │       └── Display them
   │
   └── Main Thread
       └── while(running)
           ├── Read user input
           └── Send to server
   ```

Key Communication Points:

1. **Message Sending Flow**:
   ```
   User Types → Client Main Thread → Socket → Server Handler → Process → Socket → Client Receiver Thread → Display
   ```

2. **Thread Management**:
   - Server: Uses ExecutorService for multiple clients
   - Client: Uses main thread for sending, daemon thread for receiving
   - Handler: One thread per client from server's thread pool

3. **Resource Management**:
   ```
   Resources
   ├── Server: ServerSocket, ExecutorService
   ├── Handler: Socket, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter
   └── Client: Socket, BufferedReader, BufferedWriter, Scanner
   ```

This creates a full-duplex communication system where:
- Server can handle multiple clients concurrently
- Each client can send and receive messages simultaneously
- Resources are properly managed and cleaned up
- Error handling is in place at all levels
